<h2> Description</h2> </center>
<p>Our project focuses on generating efficient particle dynamics with a flat reflective and volumetrically
   transparent body of water. Namely, we use a conical explosion to give a series of bricks appropriate
   velocity and rotation, then generate appropriate splashes and reflections as time progresses. The conical 
   explosion is user manipulated with variable strength, angle, falloff, etc. The body of water in question
   is flat so as to create simpler mathematics, and the splashes are created by generating small spherical
   droplets with random upward velocity.</p>

<h2>User Guide</h2> </center>

<p> Using our program is easy! Use the sliders at the bottom of the window
    to manipulate the angle, magnitude, source (sX, sY, sZ) and direction (dX, 1, dZ)
    of the conical explosion. Once you manipulate the sliders to as desired, press play to start 
    the simulation. You can pause the simulation at any time by pressing
    the play button again. Alternatively, you can drag the slider under the
    play button to view the simulation frame by frame. The simulation will automatically update
    as the settings are changed without the need to restart or pause the simulation.</p>
